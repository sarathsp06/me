I dislike writing about myself because I feel it’s impossible to really summarise any human being into a few paragraphs, but I’ll try to give you a tiny glimpse of who I am.

My name is Sarath S Pillai, a software engineer by profession. Here I am trying to write about technology, programming, maths and random things I learn.

 Now that I tried to write about me I realised I barely know me, maybe I will wait until i can copy it from ~~[stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1898494/sarath-sadasivan-pillai?tab=profile)~~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=sarath+sadasivan+pillai&go=Go&ns0=1) :D
