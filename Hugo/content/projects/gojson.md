#### Key Syntax
* Key is a set of `.` seperated nested keys
* Can use 0-n numbers to refer to index in arrays

### Usage Examples

##### Getting a value

* Get a string:
```sh
$ echo '{"name":{"first":"Sarath","last":"Pillai"}}' | gojson name.last
"Pillai"
```

* Get a block of JSON:
```sh
$ echo '{"name":{"first":"Sarath","last":"Pillai"}}'  | gojson name

{
  "first": "Sarath",
  "last": "Pillai"
}
```

* Try to get a non-existent key:
```sh
$ echo '{"name":{"first":"Sarath","last":"Pillai"}}' | gojson names
nil
```

Get an array value by index:
```sh
$ echo '{"people":[{"name":"saratha"},{"name":"syam"}]}' | gojson people.1.name                                               
"syam"
```
