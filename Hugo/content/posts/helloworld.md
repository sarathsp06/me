The first post has to be the ubiquitous  ***Hello World***.

##### A bit of history
“Hello, World” was created by [Brian Kernighan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/), author of one of the most widely read programming books: C Programming Language, in 1978. He first referenced ‘Hello World’ in the C Programming Language book’s predecessor: A [Tutorial Introduction to the Programming Language](https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/btut.pdf) B published in 1973.

```c
main( )
{
  extrn a, b, c;
  putchar(a); putchar(b); putchar(c); putchar(’!*n’);
 }
 a ’hell’;
 b ’o, w’;
 c ’orld’;
```

>  What I do remember is that I had seen a cartoon that showed an egg and a chick and the chick was saying, “Hello, World.”   - Brian Kernighan
