      <description>Understanding Discrete timeÂ crystals Crystals are a manifestation of systems in their lowest energy states. While normal crystals have spatial symmetry, discrete time crystals are strange crystals that have an atomic structure that repeats not just in space, but in time, putting them in constant oscillation without energy.
Is it real? It might seem pretty abstract as all we know about matter and it states is defined in terms of equilibrium, spatial symmetry etc</description>
